SmokeSmart

An Agentic AI System for Optimising Designated Smoking Areas in Singapore

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**  
SmokeSmart is a web-based prototype demonstrating how Agentic AI can support governments and urban planners in reducing second-hand smoke exposure in public spaces.

Despite strict smoking regulations, smoke exposure remains common due to static and poorly placed designated smoking areas (DSAs). SmokeSmart reframes the problem from individual behaviour to infrastructure design.

The prototype visualises where smoking occurs, highlights overcrowded or underused areas, and showcases how an Agentic AI assistant can analyse patterns and recommend where smoking areas should be added, relocated, or removed, while remaining aligned with NEA policies.

This prototype was developed for Hack for Cities 2026 to demonstrate concept feasibility and user interaction.
