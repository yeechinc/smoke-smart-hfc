# SmokeSmart for HFC 2026
**An Agentic AI System for Optimising Designated Smoking Areas in Singapore**


## **Project Description**  
SmokeSmart is a web-based prototype demonstrating how Agentic AI can support governments and urban planners in reducing second-hand smoke exposure in public spaces.

Despite strict smoking regulations, smoke exposure remains common due to static and poorly placed designated smoking areas (DSAs). SmokeSmart reframes the problem from individual behaviour to infrastructure design.

The prototype visualises where smoking occurs, highlights overcrowded or underused areas, and showcases how an Agentic AI assistant can analyse patterns and recommend where smoking areas should be added, relocated, or removed, while remaining aligned with NEA policies.

This prototype was developed for Hack for Cities 2026 to demonstrate concept feasibility and user interaction.


## **Setup Instructions**

Requirements:
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox)
- A local HTTP server (recommended)

Steps:
1. Clone or download the repository: git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git. Alternatively, run https://github.dev/yeechinc/smoke-smart-hfc on browser.
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code
3. Run a local server
4. Recommended method: VS Code Live Server extension
5. Right-click index.html
6. Select “Open with Live Server”
7. The application will open in the browser at: http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html

⚠️ Important:
Do not open index.html directly using file:// as JavaScript modules may not load correctly.


## **Usage Guide**
- Explore the Map Interface
- View simulated heatmaps showing smoking hotspots, foot traffic, and complaint density.
- Identify areas that are overcrowded, underused, or at risk of spillover into public spaces.
- Interact with the Agentic AI Chatbot
- Use the chatbot to ask planning-related questions such as: “Where are smoking complaints clustering?”, “Which smoking areas are overcrowded?”
- Review Automated Recommendations

The AI demonstrates how it would analyse patterns over time and generate policy-aligned recommendations. This showcases an agentic workflow, where the AI goes beyond answering questions to suggesting actions.

## **Deployment Notes**
This repository contains a static prototype intended for demonstration and evaluation purposes.

In a real-world deployment, SmokeSmart could be:
 1. Integrated with live datasets from public agencies
 2. Connected to real-time sensors and anonymised mobility data
 3. Deployed as a secure web application for government use

## **Additional Notes**
Limitations:
- Data shown in the prototype is simulated or static
- Recommendations are illustrative, not operational
- No real-time data ingestion or enforcement integration

Future Improvements:
- Live data integration and automated updates
- Expanded scenario simulation and optimisation
- District-level pilots and impact evaluation
- Stronger governance and explainability layers for Agentic AI
