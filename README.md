A platform to help users find designated smoking areas and avoid smoke exposure in urban spaces. By combining real-time location data and an intuitive map interface, the solution improves public health awareness, encourages responsible smoking behavior, and makes urban spaces more comfortable for everyone.

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**  
Team INSAYNE noticed that designated smoking areas in Singapore are often poorly placed or overcrowded, failing to reflect real-world smoking behaviour and leading to continued non-compliant smoking and second-hand smoke exposure. Our response was to introduce SmartSmoke, an Agentic AI - powered autonomous system capable at analysing real-time usage, air quality, and crowd data to score existing smoking areas and recommend where to add, remove, or relocate them. This enables data-driven, adaptive planning that reduces smoke exposure while maintaining regulatory oversight in Singapore.
