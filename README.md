##SmokeSmart

An Agentic AI System for Optimising Designated Smoking Areas in Singapore

**Project Description**  
SmokeSmart is a web-based prototype demonstrating how Agentic AI can support governments and urban planners in reducing second-hand smoke exposure in public spaces.

Despite strict smoking regulations, smoke exposure remains common due to static and poorly placed designated smoking areas (DSAs). SmokeSmart reframes the problem from individual behaviour to infrastructure design.

The prototype visualises where smoking occurs, highlights overcrowded or underused areas, and showcases how an Agentic AI assistant can analyse patterns and recommend where smoking areas should be added, relocated, or removed, while remaining aligned with NEA policies.

This prototype was developed for Hack for Cities 2026 to demonstrate concept feasibility and user interaction.


#**Setup Instructions**

### Requirements
- A modern web browser (Chrome / Edge / Firefox)
- A local HTTP server (recommended)

### Steps
1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
Open the project folder in VS Code

Run a local server
Recommended: VS Code Live Server extension

Right-click index.html

Select “Open with Live Server”

The application will open in the browser at:  

The interface will load locally in your browser.

#Usage Guide

Explore the Map Interface

View simulated heatmaps showing smoking hotspots, foot traffic, and complaint density.

Identify areas that are overcrowded, underused, or at risk of spillover into public spaces.

Interact with the Agentic AI Chatbot

Use the chatbot to ask planning-related questions such as:

“Where are smoking complaints clustering?”

“Which smoking areas are overcrowded?”

“Where could smoking areas be relocated to reduce exposure?”

Review Automated Recommendations

The AI demonstrates how it would analyse patterns over time and generate policy-aligned recommendations.

This showcases an agentic workflow, where the AI goes beyond answering questions to suggesting actions.

#Deployment Notes

This repository contains a static prototype intended for demonstration and evaluation purposes.

In a real-world deployment, SmokeSmart could be:

Integrated with live datasets from public agencies

Connected to real-time sensors and anonymised mobility data

Deployed as a secure web application for government use
